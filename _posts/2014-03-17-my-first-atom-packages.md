I'm finally at a state where I proudly want to tell about my first [Atom](https://atom.io/) packages.

Then [Atom](https://atom.io/) came out not long ago I was excited too see a so easy hackable text editor.
I love JavaScript and I just had too be one of the first to make good packages form this awesome editor!

I was fast too create and reserve two super light versions of [jslint](https://atom.io/packages/jslint) and [ccslint](https://atom.io/packages/csslint) which only feature was to show error reports in plain text at the bottom of the editor.

Since then [jslint](https://atom.io/packages/jslint) have had **18** version updates and [ccslint](https://atom.io/packages/csslint) **11**.
Thise updates includes a lot of new features, UI changes and of course several bug fixes.

## Features so far

 * Validate on keymap
 * Validate on command
 * Validate on save (toggle in settings)
 * Validate on change (toggle in settings)
 * Option to hide the error panel if no errors were found (toggle in settings)
 * Option to use fold mode by default (toggle in settings)

I'm in love with how easy and fun it is to write packages for [Atom](https://atom.io/), and I'm not done with the ones I have developed so far, so watch out and keep and eye on my [Atom profile page](https://atom.io/users/tcarlsen)!
